# User Data Storage  - Secure Baselines & Profile

User data (body signals, routine check-ins, baselines, profile) must be stored **securely** and **per user** so we can build baselines and profiles over time.

---

## Principles

1. **Identity**  - User is identified by **email sign-in** (no wallet required to use the app). Backend issues a **JWT** (or session token) after sign-in; all API requests use `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
2. **Data keyed by user**  - All stored data is scoped to `userId` (from JWT). No cross-user access.
3. **In transit**  - HTTPS only.
4. **At rest**  - Backend stores data in a database with encryption at rest; tokens and secrets in env, not in code.

## What We Store (Backend)

| Data | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **User** | `userId`, `email`, `createdAt`; optional `walletAddress` after connect (for premium check). |
| **Body logs** | Sleep, energy, mood, hydration, stress, weight, notes  - per day, per user. For baselines and Pulse Score history. |
| **Work routine check-ins** | Answers, timestamps  - per user. For routine pulse and insights. |
| **Baselines** | Derived: rolling averages, personal norms (e.g. sleep baseline). Computed server-side from body logs + check-ins. |
| **Profile** | Preferences, timezone, optional goals. |

## API Contract (Authenticated)

All endpoints below require `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` (from sign-in). Backend decodes JWT to get `userId` and scopes all reads/writes to that user.

- **POST /auth/sign-in**  - `{ email, password }` → `{ user: { userId, email }, accessToken }`
- **POST /auth/sign-up**  - `{ email, password }` → `{ user, accessToken }`
- **GET /users/me**  - Current user profile.
- **GET /users/me/body-logs**  - List body logs (optional `?from=&to=`).
- **POST /users/me/body-logs**  - Create body log (payload: same shape as web app `BodyLogEntry` without `id`/`date`; server sets `id`, `date`, `userId`).
- **GET /users/me/work-check-ins**  - List check-ins.
- **POST /users/me/work-check-ins**  - Create check-in.
- **GET /users/me/baselines**  - Personal baselines (sleep, energy, etc.) for AI and Pulse.
- **GET /premium/status**  - `?wallet=<address>` → `{ isPremium }` (read-only chain check for $PULSE locking).

Web app: when `VITE_API_URL` is set and user is signed in, the PWA calls the API for body logs and check-ins. When no API is configured, the app uses local-only storage (e.g. localStorage) for demo.

---

## Web: Session Storage

- **Session** (userId, email) is stored in **localStorage** (e.g. `@pulse/auth_session`) in the PWA. For production with API auth, the **accessToken** should be stored securely (e.g. memory only, or secure storage when available); never log or send passwords.
- Never log or send passwords; send only hashed or via secure sign-in request.

## Security Checklist

- [ ] HTTPS only for API.
- [ ] JWT expiry and refresh (or short-lived session).
- [ ] Passwords hashed (e.g. bcrypt) on backend; never stored plain.
- [ ] Database encryption at rest; env for secrets.
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse protection on auth and API.
- [ ] Premium check: backend verifies wallet lock (read-only) before returning `isPremium: true`.
