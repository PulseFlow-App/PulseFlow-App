# Pulse FAQ

## Product

### What is the Daily Pulse score?

A number from 0 to 100 that reflects how your body is responding on a given day. It updates in real time as you add meals, movement, sleep, mood, or body data. It’s based on *your* baseline, not generic averages.

### Is Pulse a medical or fitness app?

No. Pulse is not a medical product and not a fitness gadget. It’s an everyday system for understanding your own rhythm and making better decisions. All insights are practical and educational only — no diagnosis, no treatment, no medical advice.

### What can I log?

- Meals (text or photo, including fridge photos for meal ideas)
- Movement and workouts
- Sleep duration and quality
- Mood and energy
- Weight, body composition, smart scale data
- Optional: blood panels, body comp reports (for pattern exploration; non-medical use only)

### How does fridge-to-meals work?

You upload a photo of your fridge. Pulse detects ingredients, then suggests meals you can make with what you have, filtered by your goals (e.g. energy, time, recovery).

## Technical

### How is the Pulse score calculated?

The score is **deterministic** — produced by a weighted formula, not by an LLM. It uses sleep, nutrition, movement, and recovery relative to your personal baseline. See [AI Stack](./ai-stack.md).

### How does Pulse stay non-medical?

Through system prompt constraints, automatic disclaimers, and filters on inputs and outputs. Lab or body data is used only for pattern exploration and education, never for diagnosis or treatment.
