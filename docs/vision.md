# Pulse Vision

## Why Pulse Exists

Pulse is not a medical product and not a fitness gadget.

It is an everyday system for understanding your own rhythm, reducing noise, and making better decisions consistently  - powered by your data, shaped by your habits, and adapted to you over time.

## Philosophy

Most health apps overwhelm people with numbers, charts, and disconnected tools. Pulse does the opposite.

- **Signal over noise**  - One rhythm. One score. Personal context first.
- **Data-first**  - Your inputs become signals, not charts.
- **Non-medical**  - Practical, educational insights only. No diagnosis. No treatment.
- **Adaptive**  - Learns your baselines. No generic averages.

## Core Belief

People already generate massive amounts of personal data: food photos, workouts, smart scale metrics, sleep, mood, energy, lab results, notes, habits.

Pulse turns these **inputs into signals** that help you:

- Understand patterns
- Reduce decision fatigue
- Adapt daily routines
- Make better choices without constant tracking or analysis

## The Daily Pulse

At the core is the **Daily Pulse score (0–100)**  - a personal, adaptive indicator of how aligned today is with your baseline and goals.

As you log meals, movement, sleep, mood, or body data, the score adapts in real time. Over time, Pulse learns your personal baselines instead of relying on generic averages.

## Long-Term Vision

Pulse grows with its users:

- **MVP 1**: "Pulse helps me understand today."
- **MVP 2**: "Pulse understands me."

Everyday usefulness first. Depth second.
