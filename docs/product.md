# Pulse Product

## What Pulse Does

Pulse is a data-first wellness platform designed to turn everyday lifestyle inputs into clear, practical guidance.

It connects food, movement, recovery, and body metrics into a **single daily signal** that helps people make better decisions without constant tracking or analysis.

## Core Features

### Daily Pulse Score (0–100)

- Reflects how your body is responding on a given day
- Updates in real time as you add data
- Based on deviation from your personal baseline, not generic averages
- Minimal breakdown: Food / Movement / Recovery
- One-sentence insight per day (e.g., *"Today's Pulse dipped mainly due to low sleep consistency."*)

### Inputs → Signals

| Input | What Pulse Does |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Fridge photos** | Meal suggestions from available ingredients + personal goals |
| **Workouts & activity** | Performance and recovery signals (not raw metrics) |
| **Weight, sleep, mood, smart scale** | Track without obsessing over daily fluctuations |
| **Test results** (blood panels, body comp) | Explore patterns and trends *(non-medical, educational only)* |
