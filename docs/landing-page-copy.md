# Landing Page Copy (pulseflow.site)

Use this for the main landing at pulseflow.site. Store-safe: no crypto, no token, no locking in the hero or feature bullets. Optional "About Pulse" section at the bottom for off-app messaging.

---

## Hero / Headline

- **Headline (short):** Your daily wellness pulse.
- **Subhead:** One score. Clear insights. Less noise.
- **CTA:** Get started (links to app.pulseflow.site or App Store / PWA install)

---

## Feature Bullets (main value)

Use these as bullets or short cards on the landing page.

**Daily Pulse score**
- A single number (0–100) that reflects how your body is doing today.
- Updates as you log; based on your baseline, not generic averages.

**Body signals & routine**
- Log sleep, energy, mood, and check in on your routine.
- Get short, actionable insights instead of raw charts.

**AI that explains, not overwhelms**
- "What this means today" in plain language.
- Suggestions you can act on, not endless data.

**Premium: go deeper**
- Unlimited requests, long-term trends, and personalized baselines.
- Subscribe in the app  - one tap, no complexity.

**Your data, your control**
- Encrypted. Exportable. Never sold or shared.
- You choose what to connect and what to remove.

---

## Short Bullets (for a compact list)

- One daily score (0–100)  - your body, your baseline.
- Body signals and routine check-ins  - sleep, energy, mood.
- Clear, actionable insights  - not more dashboards.
- Premium: unlimited requests, trends, and personal baselines (subscribe in-app).
- Your data stays yours  - encrypted, exportable, never sold.

---

## Optional: "About Pulse" (off-app only)

If you have a section below the fold or on a separate page for community/protocol:

**Line (safe for landing):**
- "Pulse is an app you can use every day. $PULSE is how the system evolves."

**Bullets (off-app, no store):**
- Shape what gets built  - governance and voting on the roadmap.
- Pulse Lab  - early experiments, raw dashboards, prompt templates (web).
- Rewards and recognition for contributors (off-app).
- You don't need crypto to use Pulse; it's for those who want to help shape it.

---

## CTAs

- **Primary:** Get started → app.pulseflow.site (or "Open app")
- **Secondary:** Learn more → scroll or /about
- **Footer:** Privacy · Terms · Contact (or link to docs)

---

## Don't use on main landing

- "Lock to unlock," "Connect wallet," "Buy $PULSE," "Token holders get…"
- Any in-app flow that implies crypto is required for Premium.

Use the **Short Bullets** or **Feature Bullets** as-is or tweak for tone; keep Premium = subscribe in-app and data ownership in every version.
