# Env is per-app. Copy the example for the app you're running:
#
#   apps/mobile/.env.example  →  apps/mobile/.env   (Expo: EXPO_PUBLIC_*, Magic, API)
#   apps/web/.env.example     →  apps/web/.env     (Vite: VITE_*)
#   apps/api/.env.example     →  apps/api/.env     (Node: JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL)
#
# Do not put secrets in this repo. Each app reads .env from its own directory.
