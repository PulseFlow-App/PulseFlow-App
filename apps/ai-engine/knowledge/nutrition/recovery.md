# Recovery Nutrition (Workout, Travel, Overload)

**Topic:** Recovery Nutrition in Context

**Evidence summary:**  
Post-exercise fueling supports recovery and next-day energy. Delayed or skipped nutrition after training may increase fatigue the next day. Hydration is critical around workouts and on travel days. When sleep is compressed (e.g. late night, travel), meal timing and hydration can support recovery more than volume. For "overload" contexts (e.g. workout + party, poor sleep + high stress), the goal is damage control: timing, hydration, and lighter digestion-friendly choices rather than optimal macros.

**Relationships:**

- Post-exercise → adequate fueling and hydration support recovery; delayed intake may show up as next-day fatigue
- Travel / busy days → hydration and easy meals support energy; irregular timing often worsens fatigue
- Poor sleep + eating late → double load on recovery; earlier last meal and hydration often help
- Workout + late night (e.g. party) → prioritize pre-event meal and hydration; lighter meal later supports sleep
- Recovery mode → timing and consistency matter more than perfection or volume
