# Stress & Digestion / Appetite

**Topic:** Stress and Appetite / Digestion

**Evidence summary:**  
Stress alters appetite patterns and digestive comfort. High stress may reduce appetite in some people and increase hunger or cravings in others. Heavy or large meals during high stress may feel uncomfortable or worsen digestion. Stress physiology (e.g. cortisol, gut–brain axis) is linked to appetite and digestion in a bidirectional way. No diagnosis of conditions; focus on patterns (stress → appetite change, stress → digestion sensitivity).

**Relationships:**

- High stress → appetite may drop or become irregular; "stress appetite" patterns
- Stress + heavy meal → often associated with discomfort or bloating
- Stress → can reduce digestive ease; lighter or smaller meals may feel better
- Appetite irregularity on high-stress days → common pattern; timing and ease of meals help more than volume
- Gut–brain axis → stress and digestion influence each other; observational language only

**Allowed language:**

- "may contribute"
- "often associated with"
- "can influence"
- "tends to"
- "some people notice"
- "stress is linked to changes in appetite and digestion"

**Disallowed:**

- IBS or other condition claims
- Diagnosis (e.g. "you have stress-induced…")
- Treatment or supplement advice
- Moral framing of food (e.g. "good" vs "bad" food)

**Sources (for traceability):**

- APA stress physiology summaries
- Gut–brain axis high-level reviews (non-diagnostic)
