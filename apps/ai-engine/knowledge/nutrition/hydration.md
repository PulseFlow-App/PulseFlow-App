# Hydration & Cognitive Performance

**Topic:** Hydration and Cognitive / Physical Function

**Evidence summary:**  
Mild dehydration (e.g. 1–2% body water loss) can impair attention and executive function. Cognitive inefficiency and fatigue can appear even at mild fluid loss. Hydration timing matters: when hydration is delayed until after fatigue is felt, recovery of focus is slower. On busy or high-focus days, people often drink less; proactive hydration earlier in the day is often associated with more stable afternoon energy and attention.

**Relationships:**

- Mild dehydration → reduced attention and higher perceived fatigue
- Delayed hydration (first drink late in day) → afternoon energy dip; reactive rather than preventive
- Busy or focus-heavy days → often correlate with lower fluid intake
- Proactive hydration (sipping earlier) → often supports more stable energy and focus
- Hydration timing before perceived fatigue → more effective than catch-up later
