# Meal Timing & Circadian Rhythm

**Topic:** Meal Timing and Circadian Rhythm

**Evidence summary:**  
When you eat influences circadian alignment and metabolism. Delaying meals can shift glucose rhythms and peripheral clock gene expression. Late evening eating is associated with later sleep onset and can reduce sleep quality. Regular meal timing is associated with more stable energy and appetite regulation. Long gaps between meals may increase fatigue and irritability in some individuals. Consistency of timing often matters more than perfection.

**Relationships:**

- Late first meal (or skipped morning meal) → afternoon energy dip; appetite rhythm delayed
- Late heavy dinner → reduced sleep quality; later sleep onset
- Irregular meal timing → appetite unpredictability; harder to read hunger cues
- Consistent first-meal window → more stable energy and appetite across the day
- Eating late shifts circadian signals → can affect next-day energy and hunger
