# Protein & Energy Stability (Macro-Light)

**Topic:** Protein and Energy / Satiety (No Macro Counting)

**Evidence summary:**  
Protein at meals is associated with more stable satiety and fewer sharp hunger swings. Skipping protein at meals (e.g. breakfast) may increase appetite variability and reactive hunger later. Balanced meals—without prescribing grams—often support more stable energy than very low-protein or highly irregular eating. Focus on pattern (protein at meals, consistency) not targets. No calorie or macro counting.

**Relationships:**

- Protein at meals → often supports satiety stability; reduces reactive hunger spikes
- Skipping or very low protein at breakfast → may increase appetite swings and afternoon slump
- Balanced meals (qualitative) → often associated with more stable energy than extremes
- Irregular eating + low protein → appetite unpredictability; "under-fueled" pattern
- Consistency and timing → usually matter more than optimizing single nutrients

**Allowed language:**

- "may contribute"
- "often associated with"
- "can help stabilize"
- "tends to support"
- "some people notice"
- "balance and timing often…"

**Disallowed:**

- Grams of protein or any macro targets
- Calorie counting or targets
- "Eat X g protein per meal"
- Medical or diagnosis language
- Supplement or powder recommendations
